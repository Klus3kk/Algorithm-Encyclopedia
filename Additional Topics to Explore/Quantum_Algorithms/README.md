# **Quantum Algorithms**

## **Overview:**

Quantum Algorithms leverage quantum mechanical principles to solve problems faster than classical algorithms. They explore computation based on quantum states and operations.

## **Subtopics:**

- **Shor’s Algorithm:** Efficiently factors large integers.
- **Grover’s Algorithm:** Searches unsorted databases in quadratic time.

## **Python Example (Shor’s Algorithm):**

Note: Shor’s Algorithm is complex and typically implemented using quantum computing frameworks. Here’s a simplified Python example for factoring integers:

```python
import math

def shors_algorithm(n):
    def is_prime(num):
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            factors.append(i)
    return factors

# Example usage
print("Prime factors of 15:", shors_algorithm(15))
```

## **Explanation:**
- **Shor’s Algorithm (Simplified):** Finds prime factors of an integer, but the actual quantum version uses quantum computing to achieve faster results.
