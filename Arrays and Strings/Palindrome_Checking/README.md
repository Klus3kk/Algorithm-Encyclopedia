# **Palindrome Checking**

## **Overview**

Palindrome Checking involves determining whether a string reads the same backward as forward. This problem is common in string processing and can be solved using various methods.

## **Where is it Used?**

- **String Processing:** Validating palindromic sequences.
- **Bioinformatics:** Checking DNA sequences for palindromic structures.
- **Text Analysis:** Identifying palindromic

 substrings.

## **How Does it Work?**

The simplest approach involves comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string moving towards the center.

## **Python Example**

Hereâ€™s an example of checking if a string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

# Example usage
s = "racecar"
print("Is palindrome:", is_palindrome(s))  # Output: True
```

- **Explanation:**  
  The function `is_palindrome` compares the string to its reverse. If they are equal, the string is a palindrome.
