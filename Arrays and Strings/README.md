# **Arrays and Strings**

Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures used in programming to store sequences of elements or characters. They are often the building blocks for more complex data structures and algorithms. Understanding various techniques for manipulating arrays and strings is crucial for solving a wide range of problems efficiently.
