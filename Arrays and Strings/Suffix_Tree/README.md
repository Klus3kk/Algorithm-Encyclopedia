# **Suffix Tree**

## **Overview**

A Suffix Tree is a compressed trie of all suffixes of a string. It is a powerful data structure used for various string processing tasks, including pattern matching and substring search.

## **Where is it Used?**

- **Pattern Matching:** Efficiently finding substrings and patterns.
- **String Analysis:** Various applications in bioinformatics and text processing.

## **How Does it Work?**

A suffix tree is built by inserting all suffixes of the string into a trie-like structure, then compressing it to remove redundant nodes.

## **Python Example**

Hereâ€™s a basic example of building a suffix tree for a string (implementation can be complex):

```python
# Basic suffix tree construction (not optimized for large strings)
class SuffixTreeNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.suffix_index = -1

def build_suffix_tree(s):
    root = SuffixTreeNode()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        current = root
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            if s[j] not in current.children:
                current.children[s[j]] = SuffixTreeNode()
            current = current.children[s[j]]
            if current.suffix_index == -1:
                current.suffix_index = i
    return root

# Example usage (basic construction, search functionality not implemented)
s = "banana"
suffix_tree = build_suffix_tree(s)
```

- **Explanation:**  
  The `build_suffix_tree` function constructs a basic suffix tree by inserting all suffixes into the tree. For a fully functional suffix tree, additional methods for searching and querying would be needed.
