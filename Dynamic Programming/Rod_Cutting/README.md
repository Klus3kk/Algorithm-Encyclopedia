# **Rod Cutting**

## **Overview:**

Rod Cutting involves determining the maximum revenue obtainable by cutting a rod into pieces and selling the pieces.

## **Python Example:**

```python
def rod_cutting(prices, length):
    dp = [0] * (length + 1)

    for i in range(1, length + 1):
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for j in range(i):
            max_val = max(max_val, prices[j] + dp[i - j - 1])
        dp[i] = max_val

    return dp[length]

# Example usage
prices = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]
length = 8
print("Maximum revenue:", rod_cutting(prices, length))
```

## **Explanation:**
- **Rod Cutting:** Calculates the maximum revenue by considering all possible cuts of the rod.
