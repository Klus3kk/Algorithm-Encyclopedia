# **Interval Scheduling Maximization**

## **Overview:**

Interval scheduling maximization involves selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals from a set of intervals.

## **Python Example:**

- **Greedy Approach for Interval Scheduling:**

```python
def interval_scheduling(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end times
    selected = []
    last_end_time = -1
    
    for interval in intervals:
        if interval[0] > last_end_time:  # Non-overlapping
            selected.append(interval)
            last_end_time = interval[1]
    
    return selected

# Example usage
intervals = [(1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (8, 9), (5, 9)]
print("Maximized interval schedule:", interval_scheduling(intervals))
```

## **Explanation:**
- **Interval Scheduling:** Intervals are sorted by their end times. A greedy approach is used to select intervals that do not overlap with the previously selected interval.
