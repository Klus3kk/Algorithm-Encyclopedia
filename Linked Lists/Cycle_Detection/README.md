# **Cycle Detection (Floyd’s Cycle Detection)**

## **Overview**

Floyd’s Cycle Detection, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, is used to detect cycles in a linked list efficiently.

## **Where is it Used?**

- **Cycle Detection:** Identifying cycles in linked lists.
- **Graph Theory:** Detecting cycles in graph-related algorithms.

## **How Does it Work?**

Use two pointers moving at different speeds: a slow pointer (tortoise) and a fast pointer (hare). If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet.

## **Python Example**

Refer to the **Fast and Slow Pointers** section for an example of cycle detection.
